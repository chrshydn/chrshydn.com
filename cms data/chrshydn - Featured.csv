My focus was on identifying redundancies that led to confusion in the layout and navigation.</p><p id="""">My contributions were leading the product-thinking and design work on every aspect of the project—from creating new components and features, to remapping how our customers navigate through our feature set. We wanted to guide the user through the best possible journey with our product, enhancing their ability to utilize it fully. It became clear to us through numerous user interviews, that many of customers weren’t even aware certain features existed. These features were either hidden in menus, or locked behind status functions our customers weren’t using. Addressing these issues was a primary focus in approaching the redesign.</p><p id="""">After streamlining these aspects, we embarked on a secondary audit to determine new features and functionalities, guided by a backlog of customer feedback. This process highlighted the need to balance the integration of new features with our roadmap deadlines, and being cognizant of the technical challenges involved.</p><p id="""">Another significant improvement was the introduction of candidate email settings, which enabled admins to customize email templates—a feature highly anticipated by our customers. Previously customers had no idea of knowing what actions they took triggered an email to their candidates. Nor did they know what those emails said. Now we’ve introduced full visibility into the candidate-facing email content, as well as the ability to edit content on certain emails.</p><p id="""">As the redesign progressed, we planned a phased beta release, allowing users to opt-in and provide feedback on the new design, ensuring that Wonderlic Select would meet and exceed user needs.</p><h2 id="""">Introducing a brand new product—Wonderlic Develop.</h2>",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/6598a7289a78456e2b5fd875_wond.dvpHome.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/6598a72cffa59a65f75afa3d_wond.dvpTab2.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/65999014d5b28bbed5534354_wond.dvpResults.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/6598a730e94344098d4bee37_wond.APread.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/6598a733887272af54d84055_wond.APnotes.png,"<p id="""">Wonderlic Develop marks a significant expansion of Wonderlic's product suite, focusing on employee development using the company's expertise in cognitive, personality, and motivation assessments.
