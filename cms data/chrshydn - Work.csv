The concept was simple but overlooked: movies already have narrator tracks created by studios for accessibility, but those tracks rarely make it onto mainstream streaming platforms. Cassette set out to change that by turning movies into a fully audio experience, not just for the visually impaired community, but for anyone who wants to listen to movies on the go.</p>",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/68c0280385a9e8e973edb73b_title.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/68c02ee2673bf98602a3c5cb_cass.create%20and%20home.png,"<h6 id=""""><strong id="""">Goals:</strong></h6><ul id=""""><li id="""">Create an audio-first movie streaming platform.</li><li id="""">Make existing narrator tracks accessible to broader audiences.</li><li id="""">Design a simple, intuitive interface for browsing films and episodic content.</li><li id="""">Position the product as both an accessibility tool and a new form of entertainment.</li></ul><h6 id=""""><strong id="""">Target Audience:</strong></h6><ul id=""""><li id="""">Visually impaired users who rely on narrator tracks.</li><li id="""">Movie fans who want to enjoy films while traveling or multitasking.</li></ul>",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/68c0327e0cc7911c8abb3b24_cass.Sopranos.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/68c1671a0e426839b90aad24_cass.HookGood.png,"<p id="""">The idea came from a friend who had long been thinking about the intersection of entertainment and accessibility. He brought the vision, I took on the design. Together we explored how to present large libraries of content, how to distinguish episodic series from feature films, and how to package the product so it felt familiar but distinct from existing streaming services.</p><p id="""">My role was everything on the design side: branding, logo, marketing, website, and full UI/UX. I leaned on familiar streaming patterns from Netflix and Spotify to keep navigation effortless while shaping unique interactions tailored for audio-only use. For example, we designed a clever playback detail screen that revealed your position in the movie if you pressed and flipped the currently playing tile. This solved a tricky licensing challenge while still aligning with user needs.</p><p>As for accessibility, it wasn’t just a benefit of Cassette, but it was baked into it's core. One of the standout features was an LLM-powered search system that allowed users to ask for movies verbally. Instead of typing, a user could press a button, ask “What action movies should I listen to tonight?” and hear a spoken list of recommendations. From there, they could simply select one and start playback. This made the platform not only easier for visually impaired users navigating with screen readers but also opened up a more natural, conversational way to explore the library for everyone.</p><p id="""">We built the app into TestFlight and proved that it worked technically. While industry restrictions on licensing ultimately kept Cassette from moving forward commercially, the product itself showed what was possible in an overlooked market.</p>",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/68c032c5af1be7b2a6c50129_cass.Ask.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/68c16707d3f6e5cd80b933f3_cass.Casey.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/68c033f873f647ae933f38ad_Sidewalk%20Adstand%20(seinfeld).png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/68c034040005df66a9fc0230_Train%20Interior%20Billboard%20(Game%20of%20Thrones)%201.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/68c034441acdac312b7d7ded_cass.dude.png,,"<p id="""">For me, this was the first time designing at the scale of a streaming platform. It meant handling content-heavy layouts, playback navigation, and discovery flows across a massive library. Streaming platforms are some of the most familiar interfaces we use every day, so it was a fun challenge to meet user expectations while putting a fresh twist on the experience.</p><p id="""">Cassette was never released to the public, but the project gave me invaluable experience in designing for large-scale media consumption, balancing accessibility with mainstream appeal, and working at the intersection of design, technology, and industry constraints.</p>"

Every design choice was a response to our user's needs—making their Instagram shopping experience as effortless and magical as possible.</blockquote><p id="""">Businesses using LassoPay would need to have a Shopify merchant account, and use the LassoPay merchant app. From the app’s dashboard, they import their products and assign Lasso shortcodes to each individual product.</p><p id="""">When the merchant posts a product image and inserts the product’s shortcode in the IG caption, users could purchase that product with a single comment.

I set up auth, wired up a Supabase backend, and integrated subscriptions through RevenueCat and App Store Connect. I built out an MVP in about a month, launched it through TestFlight, and kept iterating based on feedback from friends and early users. The product was originally released as a fully paywalled app, but the pushback was immediate. At the same time, I didn't want to prevent users from experiencing what I considered the most magical part of the app—the UX. So I took it to heart and reworked the offerings into two feature sets:&nbsp;basic (free) and premium.</p><p id="""">The hardest challenge wasn't anything design related, but the data structure behind it. I had to figure out how sessions, climbs, and projects would relate without conflicts, which is something I would normally collaborate on with engineers. Solving it on my own gave me a much deeper understanding of how data, code, and UX connect.</p>",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/68c017176f139427667365e0_slop.HR%20and%20leaderboard.png; https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/658b0e5af1b468de2a7ff610/68c01775202dcf8b1b68d911_slop.tiktok.png,"<div data-rt-embed-type='true'><iframe

I know now the complexities of a working codebase, inside and out. I better understand the relationship between front-end and back-end, and some of the parameters that I can be more mindful of when making certain design decisions. But more than anything, being the first time I have owned a product from conception to launch, this experience has made me sharper, more confident, and more effective in every part of the product development process.</p>"

Noticing that these essential tools were prohibitively expensive to purchase for short-term use, the idea for Ukuu was born.</p><p id="""">The team saw an opportunity to streamline the process of renting items like these within local communities, making it more convenient and cost-effective than traditional methods like purchasing from stores or online marketplaces.</p><p id="""">The initial phase of Ukuu’s development involved moving from this conceptual understanding to a tangible product. A rough mockup of the app was created, laying the foundational blueprint of what Ukuu was set to become. This version, although functional, was somewhat basic in its design and user experience. It served as a functional beta version that was essential for gathering initial user feedback and understanding the practical dynamics of peer-to-peer lending.</p><p id="""">User feedback revealed the necessity for a trustworthy platform—one that looked more polished and in turn, secure. Moreover, practical issues such as insurance, liability, and the process for dealing with damaged items came to the forefront.
